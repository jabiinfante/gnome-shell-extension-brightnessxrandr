# Gnome Shell Extension - Brightness Control using xrand (software)

Manage every display's brightness level easily.

It uses **xrand**'s _--brightness_ option, so it does manage display brightness at a software level.

The good part? It should work **everywhere**.

### From xrand documentation:

```
    --brightness brightness

    Multiply the gamma values on the crtc currently attached to the output to specified floating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim outputs. However, this is a software only modification, if your hardware has support to actually change the brightness, you will probably prefer to use xbacklight.
```
