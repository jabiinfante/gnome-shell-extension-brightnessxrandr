# Gnome Shell Extension - (fake) Brightness Control using xrand

Manage xrand --brightness control for every display, so it does manage display brightness at a software level.

    --brightness brightness

    Multiply the gamma values on the crtc currently attached to the output to specified floating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim outputs. However, this is a software only modification, if your hardware has support to actually change the brightness, you will probably prefer to use xbacklight.
